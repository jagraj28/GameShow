Short maths quiz where the user has to answer 10 simple arithmetic questions. The final score is calculated which is then uploaded to an CSV file for storage. Dictionaries are used to store the names and scores first, and they are then written to a CSV file once the user wishes to exit the quiz. 
The user may choose to repeat the quiz multiple times, and after they have taken the quiz 3 times, an average score will be calculated for them, which will be stored in a unique dictionary and also written to a separate "Averages" CSV file.
